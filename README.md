# Sketchy Shoes Website
This is my AMIT3083 GUI & Web Application Programming Assignment. This is a web application built using java jsp, javascript, php, HTML and CSS. This is a shoes e-commerce website that customers can search and purchase shoes Customers are also able to track their order in the order history tab. It features admin system where the admin can access to special functionalities such as the sales graph of the shoes for the past few months, report on top 5 best selilng shoes presented in a pie chart, adding or removing of items. 

Features:</br>
⦁ It features user management system where user can register and login to their account and they can edit their profile. </br>
⦁ Search feature where user can search products based on the price of the shoes. </br>
⦁ It basically replicates a real world e-commerce website where customers can place order and track their order. Admin can manage items by create, retrieve, update and delete a product, view sales record and generate reports.

Weakness:</br>
Because this project was done few years back then on 2022 so I can't really remember on how to setup this project so I will attach a few videos on the website so you all can have a brief idea on how the website looks like and how it functions. The videos are recorded while developing the project so it is not the final product but I think that is good enough to deliver a the idea to everyone. It is quite unfortunate because the videos I have does not cover the whole project and it missed out some features of the website because I only record my module while I was developing them. My teammates did not record their module so no videos on their module.

This is where the admin can manage the product. This was an earlier version which the whole prototype was not done yet so the UI looks a bit off.
